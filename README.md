Amazonesque CLI App

The purpose of the Bamazon CLI app is to mimic an Amazon style storefront, via CLI and MySQL.  Initally, I started by inputing some mock data into a newly created
MySQL database.  After that the next step was to how to organize my javascript file.  Following along with in-class activities, I required the NPM packages I needed at the top. Using the cli-table package was a new experiance for me, and it did actually give me some trouble, which you will see.  Next step was to establish a connection to the database and push the information into the table.

I don't feel especially comfortable with inquirer, but it made sense to use it here, having only 2 prompts.  But after created each and assigning variables to the inputs from each query. I had to link them all together. I ran into a syntax error that I couldn't figure out unfortunately. Nor did I get to the manager functionallity.

All in all, MySQL seems fairly straight-forward.  I can see it becoming monotonous at some point, but it makes a lot more sense than some of the other types of coding we've dealt with.
